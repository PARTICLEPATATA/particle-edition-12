            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Remember- I’m in it only because Happiness and Moral asked me to make the general public aware of the world of the gods. Eh, maybe also because they promised me to take me to Disney World tomorrow. <br>
But I’m still grumpy. So listen carefully and don’t annoy me, okay? <br> <br>
‘Sausage, Joy?’ Happiness asked me. <br><br>

‘Nah. Give that one to Dad.’ <br><br>

 We were holding camp at Buffalo, shopping for nourishment and supplies. Losing the two major gods, Fortune and Chaos had shaken us up. Basically, in the winter, we had a battle with Evil, a goddess who’d gone out of control. We lost. Badly. <br>
Chaos, Luck and Fortune, three of the major gods, died. Me, Mom, the goddess Death and Dad escaped only because those three gods had died trying to save us. Then here we were, preparing for an all-out war with Evil and her cronies. <br><br>

‘Take this.’ Death, my sister, tossed me a sour candy packet. Buy one, get two free, it said. Eat them and prepare to die from the sweetness! <br>
Nah, packet, I thought to it. I’ve had enough deaths already, thank you very much. The pack didn’t reply. <br><br>

‘Okay…’ Death took stock of the supplies we’d bought. ‘Cheese, check. Macaroni, check. Bread, jam, butter, check. Pack up, guys! We have all the things we need for the next two days! Let’s
go!’ Her voice sounded a little strained. <br><br> 

‘Wha-?’ She stepped on my toes. I cornered her in the car to ask her about it. <br><br>

‘What the heck was that? I thought we had a lot more to buy?’ <br><br>

‘Yeah, we did. I was just giving you the sour candy packet when I saw a giant crocodile acting as if it
was a shopkeeper. I can easily see through such glamors.’ <br><br>

‘Mr. Croc. Why didn’t you tell Moral or something?’ <br><br>

‘Why?’ But I was hardly listening to her. ‘Mom!’ I called. <br><br>

‘I’m talking to Dad, Joy-’ <br><br>

‘Mom, Death says she saw Mr. Croc at the shop and that’s why she told us to leave.’
That made her go very still. ‘Death, is this true?’ <br><br>

Death looked sheepish. ‘Listen, Mom- I can explain. I was j-’ <br><br>

‘Death. Is this true?’ <br><br>

‘Well, yeah.’ <br><br>

‘Why didn’t you tell me?’ <br><br>

‘I took care of it myself. I mean, just because I’m younger than Joy by three years doesn’t mean I have to tell you everything, Mom. I’m fifteen.’ <br><br>

‘Death. This is a serious thing. Tell these things to us immediately if you see them from now on. Right?’, she added kind of menacingly. <br><br>

‘Okay, mom.’ <br><br>

‘Yes. Now, - Yes, driver, put us down there- no, there- two lefts up- yes- thank you.’ We got out and Moral paid the driver. We were walking towards the house, when a sudden movement to the left stopped us. ‘What’s that, Mom?’ Death asked, looking curiously at the gold, green and blue glitter swirling in the air. Mom’s face brightened up for the first time in weeks, and all of a sudden a thought struck me, and I knew who it was. Mom’s voice brought me back to reality from the big world of joy. <br><br>

‘Death- those are the standard colours of Luck.’

            <div id="highlight">
                <img src="quote.png" style="width:50px;">
                <br>
                <p id="highlight_p"><strong>Mutes are the coolest part of a trumpet. There are 3 kings of mutes the “straight”, “cup” and the “wow wow”. </strong></p>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>The person who leads the orchestra, standing between the musicians and the audience is the conductor. Most of us can relate to a conductor as a person waving a thin flashy stick around; but many don’t actually realize the value and importance of having an experienced conductor. <br><br>
In the modern orchestra the conductor’s purpose is to direct the flow of music. In simple words, to cue instruments and make sure the music comes to the audience just like the composer would have intended. Several pieces have long breaks for many instruments and for a percussionist who has to play many instruments with a short break; the conductor will cue when the performer has to move to the next instrument, or even for other instruments to start playing. <br><br>To make a piece of music sound the way the composer would have liked is much harder than it seems. Much of the music that is played by orchestras is by composers who aren’t alive, and cannot make their intentions clear. What is written (the markings, lengths of notes, softness and loudness and emphasis to be given to individual instruments when playing at once) is not as precise as it should be and the conductor has to give it his/her own feel. <br><br>
Practice makes one perfect and a conductor often heads the practice sessions for the orchestra, making several instruments play solos to make sure everything sounds the way that the composer would have liked. If the composer is are still alive, he/she will give tips on how to make it sounds better. <br><br>
During a performance we have often seen the conductor waving around this stick. This is actually called a ‘baton’ and the conductor uses this to keep rhythm. Keeping rhythm is one of the most important things a conductor has to do, because in an orchestra with several hundreds of instruments, each performer may play at their own speed causing a lot of noise. So the conductor, acting as a human metronome keeps the time for the orchestra. In fact, several different works have their own ‘time signature’ or the number of beats in a given ‘bar’. So, based on the time signature the composer moves the baton in different patterns or shapes. The easiest to recognize are 2/4 and 3/4 – where in 2/4 he moves the baton up and down and 3/4 which is a triangle. They’re easy to understand – shapes we all know. <br><br>
What makes being a conductor the hardest, is the ability to interpret a ‘score’ or a sheet of music. In order to become one, that person must have the ability to play more than at least 4 instruments or to read music and interpret for <strong>all the instruments.</strong> Most are talented pianists who then decide to train as a conductor. They must be able to deliver a piece properly, cue individual sections, read all the markings from a score and keep in mind the ‘architecture of the piece’ or how the piece will sound if all the instruments play the same passage of music at once. Unsurprisingly, most composers are conductors. After all, who knows better how the music should sound than the person who wrote it? <br><br>
A fun fact about conductors is that during the ‘baroque’ ages (between 1500 CE and 1700 CE) is that there wasn’t a baton. To keep rhythm, they would have to pound a rod on the ground, so the entire ensemble could hear it. This really didn’t work out because several conductors would often pound it on their foot accidentally and that would lead to fatal hits! <br><br>
So every time you listen to an orchestra, think about the conductor and the amount of hard work put behind the scenes and onset, to ensure that you can enjoy a single piece of music.

This is random but there are a bunch of puppies hanging out around my school and everyone would pet them and give them treats after school got over- now that we have online I hope they’re still doing well :/ <br><br> Whenever I start thinking of thoughts for 3am I get a bunch and once then forget all of them the second later- It almost feels like a dream- generally I’m also a pretty forgetful person though. Sometimes I’ll walk into a room and not know why I’m there; sometimes I’ll have something really important to do then forget what it was because I was too lazy to jot it down. <br><br>
 If watches are the mini versions of clocks then does that make smart watches the mini version of ipads or phones- o.0 <br><br>
 So a while back my mom took me to a clothes shop and forced me to try on some clothes and I just realized how much hate I have for trial rooms. The entire concept of a trial is just so weird- think about it. <br><br>
You ever wonder if people can hear your music when you're wearing headphones and then panic- <br><br>  Is it just me or do Oreo cookies taste better without dipping them in milk- all the giga chads dip marie biscuits in chai :sunglasses: <br><br>  When I think about it school is an extremely weird concept- Like, every single day a bunch of adolescents gather for 7 hours to learn the same things- and for mot people their lives kind of revolve around it. And grades are kind of like a mark to test how much you’re willing to sacrifice to learn something we’re not even interested in- unless you actually like it then gfy-  <br> editor’s note: we have nothing against school or the government haha please don’t sue us- <br><br>
I’m actually really looking forward to learning how to drive, getting my driver’s licence and blasting random songs while I go a 100 on the highway- <br><br>   Why is everyone suddenly okay with bags of flour leaking- why has no one updated flour sack technology but we’re all making toilets high tech <br><br> 
That is all for this edition, peace.

<h1>Felinology – why your cat won’t stop acting like an alien.</h1>
<h3>By Varsha</h3>
<p>Felinology - why your cat won’t stop acting like an alien   I’ve had a cat for about half a year now and I still cannot understand what’s happening in the little feline’s brain. The way she has different mews for her every need, why she constantly wants fresh food, the way she sleeps, her four small blushing paws sticking into the air are all a complete enigma to me. <br><br>  Cats are weird, I'm sure we can agree on that. <br><br>  But what triggers their peculiar behaviour? Is it something more than we can comprehend? Studying their every movement, Felinology, the science of cats is rather intriguing. Cat behaviour is peculiar but with enough research, it can be explained. <br><br>  Here are a few widely believed cat myths: <br><br>  • Cats are anti-social and unlovable - An absolute lie. A lot of cats are highly social and enjoy human contact, a happy cat will rub you and purr in your presence, which is a clear sign of affection. <br><br>  • Cats are nocturnal - cats aren’t nocturnal, but crepuscular, which means that they are most active during dawn and dusk, where the hunting opportunities are abundant, and no, cats cannot see in complete darkness. <br><br>  •They love milk - contrary to popular belief, some cats are lactose intolerant, which means that many cats cannot digest cows’ milk unless they’ve been used to it their whole life. <br><br>  Feline sleeping positions and what they signify: <br><br>   • The loaf - when your cat sleeps with their body squared and all limbs tucked in, it means that they’re laid back but attentive enough not to fall into too deep of a sleep. <br><br>  • Belly up - when they sleep with their belly facing the sky and their paws sticking out, this means that they are very comfortable in their environment and trust you. <br><br>  • Sleeping on their side - when a cat sleeps on its side, this means it’s able to fall into a deep, good sleep. <br><br>  • Sleeping with their face closed- when your cat covers its face with its paws, this means that they're trying to block out the sun, and are trying to keep their nose warm. <br><br>   Signs that your cat is content: <br><br>  • A happy cat is a vocal cat -  high pitched long meows is a sign of happiness in cats. <br><br>  • A healthy appearance - a happy cat is healthy, and often grooms itself and sometimes even its humans and other cats. <br><br>  • Social sleeping - when your cat decides to sleep near you this means that you have a healthy relationship with it. <br><br>   • Purring - while purring can also signify other emotions, a happy cat is relaxed, with its paws tucked in, purring. <br><br>  • A healthy appetite - happy cats have good appetites. like humans, unhappy cats tend to have a bad appetite, so if your kitty’s eating well, that might be a sign of contentedness. <br><br>  Cats are great, and I really hope people start to appreciate our little feline blessings. </p>

<h1>The infernal winter</h1>
<h3>By Darshan</h3>
<p>Enter Kiev, Ukraine, in the twenty ninth day of the war between the two powers - Russia and the USA. There has been tension between them for months, and Russia attacking Latvia was the last straw for the USA. Ukraine decided to support Russia, so here I am, sitting in a building bombed by one of the hundreds of F-15s, F-16s and F-35s. <br><br>
Anyway, I’m Artem, your average job-searching 18 year old, stuck in Kiev fighting for my life. The government hasn’t done anything to help us at all, they’re sitting in their mansions around the world, and anywhere the war isn’t. It’s hard living under the constant threat of being bombed or getting caught in the middle of a tank battle. <br><br>
A grenade lands right in front of me. I can recognize the sound of a grenade anywhere, I run as fast as I can, the blast hurts badly. I’ve been in the blast radius before, and the burns still haven’t healed. Just as soon as I think I’m out of danger, I see three soldiers of the Ukrainian army. I freeze, I don’t want to mess with them and risk my life. The strongest looking of the three asks “What’s your name, where are you from?” <br><br>
I take a deep breath and answer “Artem, Kiev” <br><br>
“Kiev? That wasteland? It’s been thoroughly bombed by the Americans, you shouldn’t stay there, join us back to the base.” <br><br>
“Yes, I will join you.” I’m overjoyed, I would be much safer there, and I could enlist in the army and finally get a job. We get in the armoured car and drive to the base. The streets of Kiev have become lonely; almost everyone in Kiev fled or died in all the warfare. At least my family is safe in Warsaw. <br><br>
On the way to the base the soldier reveals that his name is Anatoly and is a major in the Ukrainian army. Anatoly takes me to a dorm once we reach the base and tells me I can stay there, but I’m not sitting down here and doing nothing, I’m going to enlist. <br><br>
A few days later I get a letter, my enlistment in the army was accepted. I join as a Kursant but expected nothing less, the army needs soldiers. I ‘m going to do my best to protect Kiev, and help win the war. <br><br>
Disaster struck. <br><br>
According to spies, a minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile was headed straight for Kiev. We had to evacuate the base and leave to Boryspil in an Ilyushin Il 78. Kiev was going to be reduced to ashes, this nuke was fifteen times more powerful than the one used in Hiroshima. We didn’t have a missile defence system either and stood no chance. I bid farewell to Kiev and got on the plane. The nuke detonated soon after we landed in Boryspil, there was a huge dark cloud in the sky, and a nuclear winter to look forward to. <br><br>

            <p>“Adam, are you okay?” <br><br>
Everything was blurry. I tried to wake up, but I couldn’t. <br><br>“Adam! Wake up! ADAM!” <br><br>
I woke up with a start. I got up to my feet, and took a moment to realize that I wasn’t in the maze anymore. I was back in the forest, the maze right next to me. I found Leo right next to me, who told me that after I passed out, they found an exit and left the maze, carrying me without any encounters with that weird monster. Then while Leo tried to wake me up, Amber went ahead with the forest to see if there was anything else to deal with. <br><br>Right as we were discussing why I fainted, I saw Amber in the distance, running toward us. She screamed, “Leo! Adam! Run! A sign further ahead says, You better hurry. Something will start chasing you...” <br><br>Ah. What else could exit the maze, other than that monster? <br><br>We ran. That was our only option. Somehow, the monster wasn’t as fast as it was in the dark maze. So, the monster only attacked us quickly when it blew out the fire. Which meant that it was much less powerful under the daylight. <br><br>“Amber! Leo! Stop running! The monster is less powerful and slow at day! That’s the reason why we couldn’t beat it at the maze. But now, we can defeat it!” <br><br>“Are you sure, Adam?” Said Amber as she slowed down. <br><br>We stopped and faced the monster. “Well, so it’s time to kill Mr. Creaky Stick then.” Said Leo. <br><br>It lunged towards Leo. “Grrrr…“ It trailed off. It tried stabbing Leo with its claw, but Leo blocked the attack with his sword and he was safe. The story was not the same for his blade though. It snapped in two, just like his wand, when he was attacked for the second time. <br><br>Amber attacked the monster. “LEO! Are you alright?!” <br><br>The monster parried the attack with its claw. “Yeah, I’m fine.”, said Leo as he threw more exploding berries at the monster. “My weapons though…” <br><br>“We can get more, don’t worry. Amethius told me he has plenty, and so did Arbeal.” I said, while attacking the monster with a combination of fire and electricity. The monster took the hit, and jumped into a nearby pool to extinguish the fire. Not a good idea, because a metal body plus water plus electricity equals BOOM! It short-circuited, and then drowned. <br><br>“Well, that was easy.” Said Amber. <br><br>We walked further on, and reached the end of the forest. There wasn’t much of a gate or anything. After a while, the trees just got lesser in number until there were no trees at all. That meant we had successfully left the forest in one piece. We had passed the test. <br><br> “Great job, guys!” I said as I fainted again. <br><br>
